## Reflection Document
I bolded Each week for ease of reading
### HTML

>Picking up on html was honestly super simple. My programmer brain understood it fairly quickly as it is honestly fairly intuitive and as long as you know the basic elements, getting simple web pages started was pretty straight forward. I would honestly say that correct association between elements and how to use them is what I took away html the most at first. I would like to learn some more maybe unique html elements to add to the toolbelt.
**Week 1** was super easy to understand and honestly an amazing introduction to what makes up a web page at it's core. **Week 2** expanded on that really well in my opinion with the introduction to the wave browser and really the implications of what web developers have to consider when providing accessible pages.

### Accessibility

>Accessibility is a pretty straightforward topic in my opinion but seemingly fundamental to web development as a practice. It wasn't super hard to understand and I really wasn't going to any outside resources for help, especially since the WAVE extension is so verbose about what the errors are it's pretty easy to figure out simple accessibility issues.

### CSS

>**Week 3** made me question whether I was having fun with webdev at first I am not going to lie. CSS is way harder than basic html! Trying to align and structure the html page using CSS semantics was a logistic challenge for me. I attempted all of the CSS by myself, and was able to get it working without outside help for a decent amount of it, but I can definitely say that referring to the videos was what actually helped me finish them the correct way.  
For **week 4**, I was following a similar theme. I was trying to figure out flex boxes only using the immediate materials in this repo, and man I was struggling a lot. It wasn't until going back and getting my own fresh eyes to look at it again was I able to figure out how exactly to structure flex boxes. Again, this was because I watched the videos to figure out how to do it. I wish I started with that!  
If I remember correctly we ended up working on **weeks 5 and 6** at the same time so i'll lump them together in this analysis: **Weeks 5 and 6** were also working with css. I honestly really enjoyed css-grid as it was a lot easier than the flexbox previous to it. Bootstrap was also really cool and I think it could be pretty useful for my project.  
Overall, I really just had problems with flexbox and thought it was super difficult. I definitely think that if there was some sort of application that just helps you practice flexbox I would love to get some more reps at it. I thought that flexbox brings some pretty powerful functionality and could be super useful but I really needed to watch the videos to figure it out.

### JavaScript
>In **week 7** I was honestly doing pretty well figuring things out more on my own but had to referene the videos a decent amount. I found that the videos were definitely helpful but I honestly was looking on the internet when it came to the DOM stuff and activeEventListener as that's just syntax I wasn't familiar with. I think that the JavaScript stuff was probably the most helpful thing to learn after getting the basics of html and css because it gives you so many more options for things you can do with data.

## disclaimer: I did  **not** get JQUERY done because I didn't think we would have to finish it if it wasn't assigned anymore
